## Arithmetic Formatter
Create a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. [You can access the full project description and starter code on Repl.it.](https://repl.it/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-arithmetic-formatter)

[Solution code.](https://github.com/linasdias/py4e-project/blob/main/boilerplate-arithmetic-formatter/arithmetic_arranger.py)

## Time Calculator
Write a function named "add_time" that can add a duration to a start time and return the result. [You can access the full project description and starter code on Repl.it.](https://repl.it/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-time-calculator)

[Solution code.](https://github.com/linasdias/py4e-project/blob/main/boilerplate-time-calculator/time_calculator.py)

## Budget App
Create a "Category" class that can be used to create different budget categories. [You can access the full project description and starter code on Repl.it.](https://repl.it/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-budget-app)

[Solution code.](https://github.com/linasdias/py4e-project/blob/main/boilerplate-time-calculator/time_calculator.py)

## Polygon Area Calculator
In this project you will use object oriented programming to create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class should be a subclass of Rectangle and inherit methods and attributes. [You can access the full project description and starter code on Repl.it.](https://repl.it/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-polygon-area-calculator)

[Solution code.](https://github.com/linasdias/py4e-project/blob/main/boilerplate-polygon-area-calculator/shape_calculator.py)

## Probability Calculator
Write a program to determine the approximate probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat. [You can access the full project description and starter code on Repl.it.](https://repl.it/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-probability-calculator)

[Solution code.](https://github.com/linasdias/py4e-project/tree/main/boilerplate-probability-calculator/prob_calculator.py)
